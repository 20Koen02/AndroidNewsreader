## Todo
#### General
- [x] The app must have an Android look and feel.

- [x] The app must support both light as dark mode

#### Users
- [ ] Allow the user to login and logout (remember to clear the credentials when the user performs a logout).
- [ ] Store the userâ€™s credentials, so the user does not need to log in every time the app starts.
- [ ] Allow a user to register a new account.
- [ ] Allow the user to see a list of all his/her favorite articles (when the user is logged in)

#### Main page
- [x] The main page of the application must show a list or grid of articles; the newest article on top.
- [x] The list or grid must be implemented using a LazyColumn or some other lazy way. The backend will return articles in batches of 20.
- [ ] The list must gradually load new pages when the user reaches the bottom
- [ ] A placeholder should be visible for each image that will be fetched from the backend
- [x] Each article has various properties. At least the image and the title of the article must be shown in the list or grid.
- [ ] When the user selects an article in the list or grid, the app must navigate to the details page of that article.
- [ ] When the user is logged in, the articles in the list must show some indicator whether or not they are on the favorites (liked) list of the user.
- [x] Create a way for the user to refresh the articles on the main page (pull to refresh, or some other way to refresh)
- [ ] Show some indicator (spinner or progress bar) when the app is getting the articles, so the user knows that the app is doing something.

#### Details page
- [ ] The details page shows at least these details of an article: title, summary, image, full article url (which may reside behind a clickable View).
- [ ] The page must implement scrolling, in case the details of the article donâ€™t fit the screen of the devices.
- [ ] The full article url must be clickable and open the url in a browser.
- [ ] The page must provide a way for the user to return to the main page (donâ€™t navigate to a new instance of the main page, but go BACK to the previous page)
